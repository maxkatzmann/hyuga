## Install

### Regular Global Install

```bash
pip3 install hyuga
```

On Arch based systems, or other systems that use an externally managed Python environment where the above is not possible:
```bash
pipx install hyuga
```
Also, ensure you installed `hy` the same way via `pipx`, not `pacman`/`yay`, as the package has not yet been updated to `1.0.0`, and is currently stuck at `0.29.0-1` for the moment. This likely won't apply in the future as it will inevitably be updated, but `pipx` is generally the safer route here as it pulls it straight from pypi, and doesn't depend on a maintainer to keep it up to date. 

## Setup

### [Neovim(nvim)](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) Lua setup via [lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig)

Install [vim-hy](https://github.com/hylang/vim-hy) for filetype detection. This is optional, as you can register the filetype yourself, but you'll likely want to run this anyway if you're using Hy with Neovim, as it provides syntax highlighting among other things.

Then define an entry for Hyuga:

```lua
local lspconfig = require("lspconfig")
local lsp_configs = require("lspconfig.configs")

if not lsp_configs.hy then
  lsp_configs.hy = {
    default_config = {
      cmd = { 'hyuga' },
      filetypes = { 'hy' },
      root_dir = function(fname)
        return lspconfig.util.path.dirname(fname)
      end,
    },
    docs = {
      description = "Hyuga language server for the Hy programming language, a Python dialect of LISP"
    }
  }
end
```

And finally, don't forget to run setup! As a reference, here's how I have it set up. I prefer to defer setup (you may need to run `:LspStart` in case it doesn't auto-attach on the first `hy` file that gets opened, but only the first)
```lua
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("FileType", {
  once = true,
  pattern = 'hy',
  callback = function(_)
    local ls_entry = lsp_configs.hy
    ls_entry.setup {
      -- Any extended capabilities or custom on_attach functions go here as usual,
      -- e.g. for nvim-cmp other such plugins where you'd extend capabilities:
      -- capabilities = extended_capabilities,
      -- on_attach = custom_on_attach
      -- Can just be left blank, but included for reference. 
    }
  end
})
```
